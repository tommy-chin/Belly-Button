# Belly-Button
## Purpose
A client by the name of Roza was interested in creating a new manufactured synthetic beef which would require bacteria species that may be found in the navel. A dataset with deographic information and the bacteria species were collected from a set of volunteers and this dataset would be used to create a dashboard. This dashboard would help visualize the information from the dataset. This would provide insight to the volunteers so that they could see if their navels possessed a bacteria species that could be a future candidate to manufacture Roza's synthetic beef.
